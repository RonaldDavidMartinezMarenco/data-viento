# Dataviento: Centralizing Climate Data for Greater Resilience
**Dataviento** is a capstone project aimed at transforming the way we access and understand climate change information. Despite the abundance of open data, this information is often fragmented and too technical for the general public. This project proposes a solution to this data fragmentation through a web platform that centralizes, simplifies, and visualizes it in an intuitive way.

## The Problem
Limited access to comprehensible climate data is a significant barrier to social resilience and adaptation. As detailed in the project's problem statement, the lack of unified and easy-to-understand information hinders informed decision-making and reduces the population's capacity to respond to natural disasters. This issue directly impacts the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically targets 13.1 (resilience and adaptation) and 13.3 (education and awareness).

According to a Statista study, natural disasters in Latin America, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, increased by 23% between 2020 and 2024 compared to the 2015-2019 period (Espinosa, 2024). This highlights the urgency of strengthening adaptive capacity, which is unfeasible without a unified and legible data foundation. Furthermore, a study by IDEAM in Colombia revealed that while 98% of the population acknowledges climate change, 75% feel poorly or not at all informed on the subject (IDEAM, s.f.). This knowledge gap is representative of the situation in many regions, where technical information fails to reach the collective consciousness.

## Our Solution
Our platform addresses these challenges through the following strategy:

1. **Data Centralization**: We collect climate data from multiple verified open sources and unify them into a single database.

2. **Simplification with AI**: We use artificial intelligence to interpret complex data and translate it into intuitive visualizations (such as interactive charts) and simple narratives.

3. **Strengthening Resilience**: We provide interactive tools and practical recommendations based on data analysis to help communities better plan and adapt to local risks.

## Project Goals
General Objective: To develop an interactive web platform that centralizes, organizes, and simplifies open climate data, using artificial intelligence to interpret the information and offer comprehensible insights.

## Specific Objectives:

Collect and standardize climate data from verified open sources.

Implement AI models to translate complex indicators into intuitive visualizations.

Provide interactive tools and recommendations to improve user resilience.

## Technologies Used
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the interface and visualizations).

**Backend**: Python, FastAPI

**Database**: MYSQL

**Artificial Intelligence**: Gemini and Predicted Models.
